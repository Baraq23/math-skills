# Statistics Math Project

This program reads data from a txt file which contains data points at each line, then it computes the data and give the results of mean, median, variance and standard deviation.


## Usage

This program only runs in 64bit operating systems. The data provided must be in a txt file named data.txt and must contain values in each line of the data file.


## Installation & usage

To run the program,follow these steps:

* clone the program into your computer

```bash
https://barraotieno/gitea.com/math-skills
```

* Open the cloned folder with your prefered text editor among VScode and Vim.

* Replace the content of the data.txt with your own values to be computed

* In the terminal from your text editor type the following:
```bash
go run . data.txt
```

* Hit Enter. the Results will be shown in the terminal.

## Output

If the data provided in the data.txt file are, for example:

```bash
8  22  61
```

The output will be as follows:

```bash
Average:  30
Median:  22
Variance:  502
Standard Deviation:  22
```
